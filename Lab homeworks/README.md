## Short description about every homework.

### 1st Homework 
**analogRGBControl** - Control a RGB LED colors using the values read from 3 potentiometers.

### 2nd Homework
**KnockDetector** - Detect a knock using a passive piezo buzzer and start a buzzer sound (which can be stopped using a pushbutton) using an active piezo buzzer after five seconds after the knock.

### 3rd Homework
**4Digit_7SegmentDisplay_Control** - Control each digit from a four digit display with a joystick. We select a digit with the joystick and then, by pressing the button, it will lock in the digit so that it's value can be incremented / decremented.

### 4th Homework
**LCD_Game_Menu** - Create a simple meniu for a fictional game. It has 3 options in the main menu: play, highscore and settings. This meniu also includes a level selector, changeable player name and a number of lives. The highscore is stored on the EEPROM which allows us to track it after restarting the Arduino.
